# Tenant Reference Site

Welcome to the Tenant Reference site. This project allows realtors or property managers to create a custom reference form for past landlords to fill out and rate their former tenants. The goal is to make tenant screening more efficient by providing an easily accessible history of tenant-landlord relationships.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Builder**: Create custom forms with multiple question types (text, multiple-choice, and paragraph).
- **Form Preview**: Before sharing the form with landlords, see a live preview of how the form looks.
- **Easy Sharing**: Once the form is created, just send a link to the previous landlords to fill out.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/godfreylehokoG/Tenant_Ref.git
cd tenant-reference-site
```

2. **Open in Browser**

Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the "Create a Survey" Section**: Here you can dynamically add questions you'd like to ask former landlords. You have the option to add:
    - Text Questions
    - Multiple-Choice Questions (Yes/No)
    - Paragraph Questions (For detailed feedback)

2. **Preview Your Form**: Once you've added all your questions, you can preview the form by navigating to the "Preview Question" section.

3. **Share the Form**: After ensuring the form is as desired, share the link with landlords to gather tenant references.
